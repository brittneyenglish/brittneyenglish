<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Brittney English is a PhD candidate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology under the direction of Ayanna Howard. Her research focuses on developing exoskeletons and serious games that encourage rehabilitative motions. Her primary research interest is to develop machine learning methods for classifying a user’s mastery of a task and leveraging this information to adapt the interaction parameters of a serious game in order to provide the most optimal difficulty, allowing for users to learn the task most efficiently. </p>
<p>Brittney received a BS in Computer Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2011 and an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Florida in 2013. She has worked for the Naval Surface Warfare Center and Air Force Research Laboratories. Brittney is very involved in outreach and has mentored and been the graduate student assistant for the Opportunity Research Scholars (ORS) Program, the graduate student coordinator for the Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) Robotics Program, and a teacher for Women In Engineering Technology, Engineering, and Computing (TEC) camp. Brittney’s research has received many accolades, including being recognized with the NCWIT Collegiate Award Honorable Mention, RESNA Student Design Competition Finalist, and in articles including “<a href="http://www.news.gatech.edu/features/women-robotics">Women in Robotics</a>," “<a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/news/437451/phd-research-mentor-brittney-english-pays-it-forward">Ph.D. Research Mentor Brittney English Pays It Forward</a>," and “<a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/news/593705/brittney-english-applies-lessons-childhood-engineering-outreach">Brittney English Applies Lessons from Childhood to Engineering Outreach</a>."</p>
